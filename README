SUBJECTIVE: Windows Port of the Objective-C 2.0 Runtime
============================================================================

     This is a work in progress. Please be *impatient*, contribute!

SUBJECTIVE is an attempt to bring Objective C 2.0 with ARC support to Windows.


This project is a fork of objc4-532.2, the Objective C runtime that ships with
OS X 10.8.5. The port can be compiled using llvm-clang either on OS X or on
Windows. In the former case you will need the MinGW cross-compiler package
for OS X. On both platforms clang is used for compiling the source, whereas
either the MinGW/GNU linker or the MS linker is used for linking the final
binaries.


Current limitations:

• 32-bit only
• No closures/blocks
• No old style GC
• Internals: no vtables, no gdb support, just plain malloc, no
preoptimizations, no "zero-cost try"

Many of these limitations apply to ObjC on 32-bit iOS systems anyway.


Prerequisites (OS X):

• MinGW cross-compile environment for OS X:
http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php

• Xcode 5.x; clang shipped with Xcode suits fine
